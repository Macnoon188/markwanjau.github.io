      <p>In April 2025, a critical vulnerability identified as CVE-2025-29824 was discovered in the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) driver. This use-after-free flaw allows authorized attackers to locally elevate their privileges, posing significant security risks to affected systems (National Vulnerability Database, 2025).</p>
      <p>The Windows CLFS driver is integral to log management. CVE-2025-29824 exploits a use-after-free condition, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. Such vulnerabilities serve as entry points for more severe exploits, including ransomware deployments (Microsoft Security Response Center, 2025).</p>

        <h2>Detection Using Wazuh</h2>
        <p>A virtual lab was created using Proxmox with a vulnerable Windows Server instance. Wazuh, an open-source SIEM, was deployed and configured with custom rules for CVE-2025-29824 detection.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wazuh alerting identified anomaly on Windows Server node</li>
          <li>Confirmed vulnerability presence through MITRE CVE database</li>
          <li>Applied PowerShell-based mitigation from Vicarius</li>
          <li>Validated success by clearing related SIEM alerts</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Mitigation Strategies</h2>
      <img src="images/Patch Screenshot.jpg" alt="Patch Screenshot" class="single-img">
      <p>Following detection:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Applied Microsoft patch released in April 2025.</li>
		<p>Patch Application: The latest security updates from Microsoft were applied to address CVE-2025-29824. Microsoft had released patches on April 
		8, 2025, to rectify this issue .(Microsoft, CVE Details)</p>
        <li>Hardened the system with access control and segmentation.</li>
		<p>System Hardening: Additional security measures, including the implementation of strict access controls and regular system audits, were 
		enforced to reduce the attack surface.</p>
        <li>Continued live monitoring using Wazuh post-patch.</li>
		<p>Continuous Monitoring: Wazuh's monitoring capabilities were leveraged to ensure ongoing surveillance for any anomalous activities 
		post-mitigation.</p>
      </ol>
